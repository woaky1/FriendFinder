# FriendFinder
A friend compatibility app made as an exercise for learning Node.js and Express

## App Organization
This app is made of files that can be grouped into four categories.

1. server.js: This file is our server and the linchpin holding everything together.

2. Data: These include friends.js and friendshipCalc.js, files where data is stored and processed.

3. Public: These are the html files we serve the user.

4. Routing: These files handle the incoming requests from the user and serve them the appropriate files.

*Note: There's no guarantee that the result will be your perfect friend. This quiz is highly unscientific. It's a coding exercise.
